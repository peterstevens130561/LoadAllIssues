# LoadAllIssues
Well, this started as a small attempt to Load All Issues in SonarQube using the REST api. However, over time it turned into a
little project to create a real connector that supports all APIs. Still work in progress.

The biggest issue at this moment is that the connector is not in its own solution, which it should be.
